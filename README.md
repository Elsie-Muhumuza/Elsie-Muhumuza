### **ðŸ“‚ Featured Projects**

Explore some of my work where I apply data science principles to diverse challenges:

* [**Loan Eligibility Prediction**](https://github.com/Elsie-Muhumuza/Loan-Eligibility-Prediction-Model) â€” Built a machine learning model for Dream Housing Finance to automate loan eligibility decisions. The optimized Random Forest Classifier reached 85% accuracy, streamlining approvals and improving decision reliability.
* [**Customer_Segmentation_Analysis**](https://github.com/Elsie-Muhumuza/Customer_Segmentation_Analysis.git) â€” Applied unsupervised machine learning (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering) to segment a credit card company's customer base into distinct profiles. This analysis successfully identified a critical "High-Risk Defaulter" segment, enabling the development of targeted risk mitigation strategies.
* [**Footwear Sales Data Analysis**](https://github.com/Elsie-Muhumuza/Footwear-Sales-Data-Analysis) â€” Performed visual analytics on sales data to identify key trends and patterns for a footwear company. Found top-performing brands that generated 60%+ of net profit, guiding inventory allocation and marketing strategies.
* [**Global Literacy Rates Analysis**](https://github.com/Elsie-Muhumuza/Literacy-Rates-Analysis) â€” Conducted an in-depth data analysis to uncover regional disparities and gender gaps in global literacy, providing strategic recommendations for a non-profit organization's targeted educational interventions.
